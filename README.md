# Email Spam Classification

This project is a Streamlit web application that uses a Bernoulli Naive Bayes model to classify email text as spam or not spam. The application preprocesses the input text, converts it into a vectorized format using a `CountVectorizer`, and predicts whether the email is spam based on the trained model.
